 * saturated one, which needs a darker wing than the other two or the whole
 * bird flattens into the background.
 *
 * The face runs warm in every scheme — the hue offsets below are why a teal owl
 * still has a cream face rather than a teal one, and they are what stops ten
 * palettes reading as one palette at ten temperatures.
 *
 * The plate is also lighter against the body here than on the artboard. At the
 * size a member list draws an avatar, the reference's four points of lightness
 * between the two disappear and the owl loses its face.
 *
 * `trim` stays inside the palette's own hue, because that is what the drawn
 * accessories do — the bow tie, the winter hat and the headphone pads are the
 * bird's own colour at a different lightness, not a contrasting one. Which
 * lightness depends on the scheme: a dark owl needs a light bow tie and a pale
 * owl a dark one, and getting that backwards is a smudge under the chin.
