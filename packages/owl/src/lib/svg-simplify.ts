/**
 * Shrinking a path without changing what it draws.
 *
 * There is a standard tool for this — SVGO, whose `convertPathData` does the
 * same job and more. It is not a dependency here because this is the only thing
 * in the repository that would want it, it runs at build time on fourteen
 * files, and the part that actually matters is fifty lines. If the artwork ever
 * grows past what this handles, reach for SVGO rather than growing this.
 *
 * The problem it solves: a traced bitmap arrives with far more precision and far
 * more points than a 1024-unit box can show. The winter jacket is the extreme
 * case at 3850 numbers, most of them to three decimals — at the size an avatar
 * renders that is a ten thousandth of a pixel, and every one of those digits is
 * shipped to every client that sees somebody wearing it.
 *
 * This is the closest thing here to merging vertices by distance: rounding pulls
 * near-coincident points onto each other, and the passes after it delete what
 * that leaves behind.
