/**
 * Choosing what your owl looks like, instead of only what your name hashes to.

 * This lets somebody take that owl and choose its colours, its expression and
 * what it is wearing.
 *
 * Three columns: the slots on a rail, every option for the chosen slot as a
 * grid of owls, and the owl itself pinned on the right where it does not scroll
 * away. That last part is the whole reason for this shape — comparing two hats
 * should be looking rather than remembering.
 *
 * Options are drawn, never named. The expression slot holds fourteen things and

          Gryt UI's vertical Tabs, not a row of buttons.

          This was hand-rolled, and the two things that gave it away were
          the two things Tabs brings: nothing slid between panes because
          there was no Indicator, and nothing grew or shrank under the
          cursor because the buttons only animated their colour. The grid of
          owls immediately below does have the spring, which is what made
          the rail feel dead next to it.

          The scale classes are passed per tab rather than lived with,
          because @gryt/ui's Tab has no press feedback of its own yet.
          Matching Button exactly: 1.03 on hover, 0.96 on press, on the
          spring duration and curve.
